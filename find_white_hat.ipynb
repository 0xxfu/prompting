The primary food source of the ferret is the prairie dog. Rather than try and nab these little suckers above ground, the black-footed ferret tracks prairie dogs to their colony.\\nThen, the predator waits for his prey to fall asleep before slinking in the front door and moving through the colony quietly.

       "  'content': \"10 Creatures That Are Nature's Most Efficient Killers\\nVote for the creatures that know how take down their prey.\\n- 1\\nThe Black-Footed Ferret Hunts Its Prey At Home\\nThe cute little fella you see in the picture may be endearing, but its also an efficient and ruthless killer. The primary food source of the ferret is the prairie dog. Rather than try and nab these little suckers above ground, the black-footed ferret tracks prairie dogs to their colony.\\nThen, the predator waits for his prey to fall asleep before slinking in the front door and moving through the colony quietly. The ferret will crawl up to a sleeping prairie dog and knock its head to wake it up. As the prairie dog rears up, it exposes its throat. The ferret lunges and the prairie dog is killed with essentially no noise, a tactic that allows the ferret to clean house over the course of the evening.\\nEfficient hunter? - 2\\nThe Grass Snake Has Turned Patience Into A Way Of Life\\nFound throughout Europe, North Africa, and Asia, the grass snake poses zero threat to most people. The worst you have to fear from them is a start when they’re hanging out around your outdoor pond. For the frogs, mice, and other small rodents that get close, however, things aren’t so rosy.\\nGrass snakes have managed to survive for incredible lengths of time on basically no food because of their means of digestion. Grass snakes sit and wait for prey to come within striking distance, then with one quick strike, the unfortunate animal is swallowed whole and digested alive.\\nWith minimal effort and a patient digestive system, the grass snake can survive for up to a year on as little as ten frogs.\\nEfficient hunter? - 3\\nRituals And Cooperation Work Well For The African Wild Dog\\nSome numbers put the African wild dog’s hunt-kill success rate at around 85 percent. Thanks to an incredibly egalitarian social structure, African wild dogs never have to worry about bucking for control. Instead, everything is shared equally, so teamwork reigns. Of course, that sucks for the local wildlife.\\nDuring a hunt, this also means that the work is shared. The pack takes down their prey by rotating its members in lines (like on a hockey team), keeping its strongest hunters up front while giving the others time to rest.\\nWhen the hunt is over, the youngest members of the family are fed first, then the remaining meat is shared evenly among the adults.\\nEfficient hunter? - 4\\nDragonflies Catch More Than 90 Percent Of Their Prey\\nThanks to a specialized type of eye that allows dragonflies to see black spots against the sky, this airborne predator can easily spot normal flies moving in formation.\\nWhat’s more, a dragonfly’s wings make most fighter jets look humdrum. A dragonfly can fly straight up or straight down and the muscles in each of their four wings can operate independently, allowing for incredible speed and agility. Of course, according to neuroscientist Anthony Leonardo, the dragonfly’s most prized asset is its brain.\\n“The brain uses a highly optimized hunting strategy that allows the dragonfly to predict where the prey is going and the appropriate muscle commands to intercept it,” he says.\\nEfficient hunter? - 5\\nBlack-Footed Cats Can Kill 10-14 Creatures Every Night\\n- Photo:\\n- Patrick Ch. Apfeld, derivative editing by Poke2001\\n- Wikimedia Commons\\n- CC-BY 3.0\\nThe solitary hunters of South Africa, the black-footed cats are the smallest species of wild cat on the continent. Though they’re only about four pounds when fully grown, studies have put this cat’s success rate at about 60 percent. Though they don’t necessarily have any spectacularly new method of murder - just plain, old-fashioned viciousness - they’ve managed to perfect the art of stalking and killing.\\nOver the course of one night, this cat can range as far as five miles, attempting a kill every 30 minutes. These black-footed cats are capable of taking down animals like the wild hare, which are bigger than the cats themselves (by a few pounds).\\nEfficient hunter? - Photo:\\n- 6\\nThe Asian Giant Hornet Can Take Out 20 Victims A Minute\\n- Photo:\\n- NUMBER7isBEST\\n- Wikimedia Commons\\n- CC-BY-SA 4.0\\nThough one to two stings from the Asian giant hornet can prove fatal to humans, they prefer to wreak havoc on colonies of honey bees. A group of no more than thirty of these incredibly talented killers can wipe out an entire colony of 30,000 bees in just a few hours.\\nEven more disturbing, Asian giant hornets prefer to swoop down on their prey, using their mandibles to decapitate their targets. Asian giant hornets can grow up to two inches in length and are capable of stinging a human through a rain jacket. What’s more, the venom in that stinger is designed to break down the cells in your flesh and send searing, intense pain through your nerve cells.\\nEfficient hunter? - Photo:\"}]"
