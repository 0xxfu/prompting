### Productizing other subnets with Apex
Apex is also powering inference across Bittensor. It's integrated with Squad.ai, Rayon Labs' agent platform built on SN64, Chutes - which means that Apex provides the reasoning abilities for agents built on Squad, boosting their capabilities and adding value to Rayon Labs through its cost-effective efficiencies. In other words, Apex provides more agentic opportunities to Bittensor.

## Market Opportunity & Traction

Subnet 1 provides access to decentralized, competitive intelligence. As its speed of inference continues to rise, and miner efficiencies compound, Apex is able to provide fast, flexible, and efficient inference at scale. With the market for AI applications only growing, the ability to provide fast, efficient inference while keeping cost per token low will become increasingly desirable, putting Apex in a strong position to benefit - and making it a strong investment proposition.

By combining real‑time web search with LLM‑grade synthesis in a single, developer‑friendly endpoint, the service sits squarely at the intersection of two explosive trends — AI‑native application stacks and the API‑first economy. Demand spans customer-facing chatbots, autonomous agents, research copilots, and data‑driven decision dashboards, giving the platform both horizontal reach and strong pricing power. Early adopters report dramatic boosts in user engagement and analyst productivity, and investors view the recurring‑revenue potential as "SaaS‑plus," since the engine continuously improves with every query. In short, the product is meeting a surging, underserved need at precisely the right moment, positioning it for rapid, sustainable growth.

### Long-term value potential
Thanks to its distributed architecture, Apex has the potential to provide inference at a scale, speed, and efficiency outmatching centralized competitors.

Moreover, many of the most valuable use cases for AI - including law, finance, and health - are so sensitive to data privacy that they cannot use centralized models. This creates a huge opportunity for decentralized competitors to provide decentralized alternatives that provide intelligence without amassing centralized data. As the most intelligent model on Bittensor, itself the foremost DeAI protocol on-chain, Apex is very well positioned to take advantage of this opportunity. For those who believe in DeAI, an investment in Subnet 1 represents a strong prospect.

### Interest from customers and users
Subnet 1, Apex has already built up strong support and positive user feedback. It consistently ranks in the top 10 subnets. It displays deep and broad market support. Along with Subnet 13, another Macrocosmos subnet, Apex was the only subnet to be available on Squad.ai, Rayon Labs' agent platform built on Subnet 64, Chutes (itself the top-performing subnet on Bittensor) - showing its reliability, value, and desirability across Bittensor.

## Key Use Cases & Potential
Subnet 1, Apex, has a range of use-cases:
*   Agentic chat interfaces, designed to plug into other subnets or commercial tools.
*   Fast and very cheap web search enhanced LLM inference.
*   Deep research and reasoning models that can tackle complex mathematical and logic-based problems.

Apex has the potential to become the flagship decentralized LLM experience across the tech world. By utilizing Bittensor's architecture, we offer speedy and low-cost inference that could soon rival SOTA models in the industry.

## The Team Behind Subnet 1
Subnet 1 was built by Dr. Steffen Cruz, AKA @Macrocrux, when he was CTO of Bittensor. Steffen has led Apex through multiple iterations, overseeing its evolution into Bittensor's premiere provider of decentralized intelligence.

Apex's engineering team is one of the most impressive on Bittensor. It includes Felix Quinque, who led its Chain of Thought, Reasoning, and Logits upgrades, Dmytro Bobrenko with Organic Scoring and DeepResearcher, Rich Wardle's research and development, and Kalei Brady, who led GAN based architecture upgrade and leads SN1's Discord Community. It also receives the support of other Macrocosmos engineers, ensuring that Subnet 1 is one of the best-staffed projects on the protocol - all of which helps ensure its long-term viability.

### Why this team is right for the project
Steffen Cruz designed Subnet 1 while CTO of Bittensor. His continued stewardship ensures ongoing retained knowledge, accrued from years of experience building on Bittensor and a deep understanding of how best to convene state-of-the-art intelligence on chain.

Will Squires, CEO and co-founder of Macrocosmos, first began working with Jacob Steeves (@Const) during Bittensor's Revolution upgrade in October 2023, meaning that Will contributed to the release enabling multiple subnets. Will's strong commercial background leading large multinational companies, combined with his experience in creating and leading AI start-up teams, ensure that Subnet 1, Apex has a strong leadership capable of both delivering innovation and establishing commercially viable partnerships.

## Technical Foundation (For Developers)
This repo defines an incentive mechanism to create a distributed conversational AI for Subnet 1 (SN1). Validators and miners are based on large language models (LLM). The validation process uses **internet-scale datasets and goal-driven behaviour to drive human-like conversations**. To learn more about the Bittensor project and the underlying mechanics, [read here.](https://docs.bittensor.com/).

### Agentic Tasks
Subnet one utilizes the concept of "Tasks" to control the behavior of miners. Validator create a variety of tasks, which include a "challenge" for the miner to solve, and sends them to 100 miners, scoring all the completions they send back.

#### Task Descriptions
1.  **Inference**
    A question is given with some pre-seeded information and a random seed. The miner must perform an inference based on this information to provide the correct answer. Completions are scored based on similarity metrics.

2.  **Multistep Reasoning (MSRv2)**
    This task operates in two stages: generative and discriminative.
    In the generative stage, a single miner receives a challenge and generates a response.
    In the discriminative stage, this generated response (or sometimes a validator-provided "real" answer) is presented to a set of discriminator miners. These discriminators must output a score (0-1) assessing the answer.
    Rewards are then calculated: discriminators are rewarded based on how accurately their score reflects the ground truth (i.e., whether the answer was miner-generated or real). The original generator miner is rewarded based on the collective assessment of the discriminators. If a "real" answer was used, this portion of the reward is distributed among other non-discriminating miners.

3.  **Web Retrieval**
    The miner is given a question based on a random web page and must return a scraped website that contains the answer. This requires searching the web to locate the most accurate and reliable source to provide the answer. The miner is scored based on the embedding similarity between the answer it returns and the original website that the validator generated the reference from.
